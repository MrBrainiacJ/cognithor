### Output type: `Grid`

| Name | Signature | Cost | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bounding_box` | `(Object) → Grid` | 1.50 | Render the object as a tight grid of size = bbox dimensions. Pixels inside the object get its color, pixels outside get 0. |
| `complete_symmetry_antidiag` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.70 | Fill in the (square) grid so it is symmetric across its anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). Non-square grids fall back to the input unchanged. Existing non-zero cells are preserved; zero cells are filled from their anti-transposed partner. |
| `complete_symmetry_d` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.70 | Fill in the (square) grid so it is symmetric across its main diagonal (transpose mirror). Non-square grids fall back to the input unchanged — Phase-1 search must guard with the shape check upstream. Existing non-zero cells are preserved; zero cells are filled from their transposed partner. |
| `complete_symmetry_h` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.50 | Fill in the grid so it is symmetric across its vertical axis (left-right mirror). Existing non-zero cells are preserved; zero cells are filled from their horizontal partner if that partner is non-zero. Solves ARC tasks with horizontally-defaced symmetric figures. |
| `complete_symmetry_v` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.50 | Fill in the grid so it is symmetric across its horizontal axis (top-bottom mirror). Existing non-zero cells are preserved; zero cells are filled from their vertical partner if that partner is non-zero. Solves ARC tasks with vertically-defaced symmetric figures. |
| `count_components` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.50 | Count the number of 4-connected non-zero components and return a 1×1 grid containing that count as its single colour. Counts saturate at 9 (the ARC colour range). |
| `crop_bbox` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 1.50 | Crop to the bounding box of all non-background pixels (background = most-common color). Returns a 1×1 grid containing the background color if the grid is uniformly background. |
| `crop_largest_component` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.50 | Find the largest 4-connected non-zero component and return its bounding-box subgrid (other cells in the bbox stay zero). Differs from `crop_bbox` (which crops to the bbox of every non-background cell jointly): solves ARC tasks where the rule is 'extract the dominant shape, drop the rest'. |
| `fill_with_most_common_color` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 1.50 | Return a grid of the same shape as the input, filled with its most-frequent colour (ties broken by lowest index, matching `most_common_color`). Solves ARC tasks of the 5582e5ca family where the rule is 'collapse the input to its dominant colour'. |
| `frame` | `(Grid, Color) → Grid` | 1.80 | Draw a 1-pixel border of *color* around the grid edge, leaving the interior unchanged. Grid must be at least 1×1. |
| `gravity_down` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.00 | Pull all non-background pixels in each column toward the bottom edge. |
| `gravity_left` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.00 | Pull all non-background pixels in each row toward the left edge. |
| `gravity_right` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.00 | Pull all non-background pixels in each row toward the right edge. |
| `gravity_up` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.00 | Pull all non-background pixels in each column toward the top edge. |
| `identity` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 0.10 | Return the grid unchanged. Cheap building block for branches. |
| `mask_apply` | `(Grid, Mask, Color) → Grid` | 2.00 | Set every cell of the grid where *mask* is True to *color*. Mask shape must match the grid shape exactly. |
| `mirror_antidiagonal` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 1.20 | Mirror across the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). |
| `mirror_diagonal` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 1.20 | Mirror across the main diagonal. Equivalent to transpose for square grids. |
| `mirror_horizontal` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 1.00 | Flip the grid left-to-right (mirror across the vertical axis). |
| `mirror_vertical` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 1.00 | Flip the grid top-to-bottom (mirror across the horizontal axis). |
| `overlay` | `(Grid, Grid, Color) → Grid` | 2.50 | Overlay *top* onto *base*: cells of *top* equal to *transparent_color* are skipped, all other cells overwrite *base*. Both grids must have the same shape. |
| `pad_with` | `(Grid, Color, Int) → Grid` | 1.80 | Pad the grid on all four sides with *width* pixels of *color*. Width must be ≥ 0. |
| `recolor` | `(Grid, Color, Color) → Grid` | 1.50 | Replace every occurrence of color *src* with color *dst*. |
| `recolor_by_component_size` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 3.00 | Recolour every 4-connected non-zero component so its colour equals its size, capped at 9. Background cells (colour 0) are preserved. |
| `remove_singletons` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.50 | Replace every cell whose colour has no orthogonal same-colour neighbour with 0. Background cells (colour 0) are preserved. |
| `render_objects` | `(ObjectSet, Grid) → Grid` | 2.00 | Paint every object in the set onto a copy of *base*. Cells outside the grid are silently dropped (clip-to-edge). Later objects overwrite earlier ones at overlapping cells. |
| `replace_background` | `(Grid, Color) → Grid` | 1.50 | Replace the background (most-common color) with the given color. Equivalent to ``recolor(grid, most_common_color(grid), new)``. |
| `rotate180` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 1.00 | Rotate the grid 180°. |
| `rotate270` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 1.00 | Rotate the grid 270° clockwise (= 90° counter-clockwise). |
| `rotate90` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 1.00 | Rotate the grid 90° clockwise. |
| `scale_down_2x` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.00 | Scale the grid down by 2× by sampling the top-left pixel of each 2×2 block. Odd dimensions are truncated. Only valid for grids with shape ≥ 2×2. |
| `scale_up_2x` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.00 | Scale the grid up by 2× (each pixel becomes a 2×2 block). |
| `scale_up_3x` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.00 | Scale the grid up by 3× (each pixel becomes a 3×3 block). |
| `self_tile_by_mask` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 3.00 | Fractal self-tile: tile the grid by itself using its non-zero cells as a placement mask. Output shape = (R*R, C*C) for an R×C input. For each input cell (i, j), if grid[i, j] != 0 the entire input is stamped at output block (i*R..i*R+R, j*C..j*C+C); otherwise that block stays zero. Solves ARC tasks of the 007bbfb7 family. |
| `shift` | `(Grid, Int, Int) → Grid` | 2.00 | Shift the grid by (dy, dx). Pixels that fall off the edge are dropped, exposed cells are filled with the background (most-common color). Range is unrestricted; large shifts collapse the output to all-background. |
| `stack_horizontal` | `(Grid, Grid) → Grid` | 2.00 | Stack two grids side-by-side (left-to-right). Row counts must match; output cols = left.cols + right.cols. |
| `stack_vertical` | `(Grid, Grid) → Grid` | 2.00 | Stack two grids top-to-bottom. Column counts must match; output rows = top.rows + bottom.rows. |
| `swap_colors` | `(Grid, Color, Color) → Grid` | 1.50 | Swap two colors throughout the grid. |
| `tile_2x` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.00 | Tile the grid in a 2×2 pattern (output dimensions = input × 2). |
| `tile_3x` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 2.50 | Tile the grid in a 3×3 pattern (output dimensions = input × 3). |
| `transpose` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 1.00 | Transpose: swap rows and columns (flip across main diagonal). |
| `unique_colors_diagonal` | `(Grid) → Grid` | 3.00 | Extract the sorted set of unique non-zero colours in the input and return an N×N grid whose main diagonal contains those colours (N = number of unique non-zero colours). The off-diagonal cells are zero. When the input has no non-zero colours, returns a 1×1 zero grid. |
| `wrap_shift` | `(Grid, Int, Int) → Grid` | 2.20 | Shift the grid by (dy, dx) with toroidal wrap-around (numpy.roll). |

### Output type: `Mask`

| Name | Signature | Cost | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

### Output type: `Object`

| Name | Signature | Cost | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `align_to` | `(Object, Object, AlignMode) → Object` | 3.00 | Translate object A so its bounding box aligns with B's per *mode*. CENTER aligns both axes; the four edges align that axis and centre the other; corners align both axes simultaneously. |
| `largest_object` | `(ObjectSet) → Object` | 1.50 | Object with the largest pixel count in the set. Ties broken by discovery order (first occurrence wins). |
| `smallest_object` | `(ObjectSet) → Object` | 1.50 | Object with the smallest pixel count in the set. Ties broken by discovery order (first occurrence wins). |

### Output type: `ObjectSet`

| Name | Signature | Cost | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `connected_components_4` | `(Grid) → ObjectSet` | 2.50 | 4-connectivity flood-fill of all non-background pixels. Background = most-common color (excluded from output). |
| `connected_components_8` | `(Grid) → ObjectSet` | 2.50 | 8-connectivity flood-fill of all non-background pixels. Diagonal neighbours count; otherwise identical to ``connected_components_4``. |
| `filter_objects` | `(ObjectSet, Predicate) → ObjectSet` | 2.50 | Keep only objects for which *pred* is True. The predicate's is_largest_in / is_smallest_in receive the original ObjectSet as context so 'largest' refers to the input set, not the filtered output. |
| `map_objects` | `(ObjectSet, Lambda) → ObjectSet` | 3.00 | Apply *fn* to every object in the set; return the resulting ObjectSet in the same order. Pure, no in-place mutation. |
| `objects_of_color` | `(Grid, Color) → ObjectSet` | 2.00 | Return the 4-connected components whose color matches the argument. Treats the requested color as foreground regardless of background. |
| `sort_objects` | `(ObjectSet, SortKey) → ObjectSet` | 2.50 | Stable-sort the set by *key*. Ties break by discovery order so the result is reproducible across runs (cache-stable). |

### Output type: `Lambda`

| Name | Signature | Cost | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `branch` | `(Predicate, Lambda, Lambda) → Lambda` | 3.50 | Build a conditional Lambda: ``λobj. then_fn(obj) if pred(obj) else else_fn(obj)``. Sub-tiefe ≤ 1 — nested ``branch`` forbidden in Phase 1 (spec §7.5). |
